The convenience sampling method was used to select the subjects. Thirty-three anthropometric dimensions were measured. The mean; standard deviations; coefficients of variation; independent t-test; and 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile values were determined. The results revealed differences between dimensions for men and women, indicating that men showed prominent results. Moreover, there was a comparison between some dimensions with the results of other counties. The findings of this study provide values of anthropometric data in the aging population of Thailand. Implementing anthropometric data to reduce the mismatch between the aging workers and their work performance is crucial for designing farm tools and designing a safe variety of products and a healthy environment for the elderly.'},\n",

The results revealed that the average WAI was 31.40 Â± 4.15. 76.10% of the participants qualified for the moderate work ability index. The number of current diseases, age, and monthly income were found to significantly contribute to the prediction of the WAI (p < 0.05). This finding suggests that the relevant agencies should support a policy, project or program related to health promotion among the working population with physical health conditions. Promoting occupations should be considered to raise income policy. In doing so, work ability among the working population may be improved.'},\n",

General information, gross anatomy laboratory room characteristics, and symptoms of respiratory illness during gross anatomy dissection were assessed. The environmental parameters related to indoor air quality, total fungi, and bacteria in a gross anatomy dissection room were measured. Pearsonâ€™s correlation, spearmanâ€™s rank correlation and regression analysis were used to analyse data. The findings revealed ten factors significantly associated with respiratory illness (P < 0.05). The six influencing variables including formaldehyde concentration (personal sampling), bacteria, relative humidity, fungi, time of gross anatomy dissection class, and formaldehyde concentration (area sampling) as tested using regression analysis. ANN model was then run to predict the respiratory illness from those six variables. Predictive accuracy was assessed by the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value. ANN model showed the least value of MAD, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE when comparing an error value of less than 10%. Therefore, the ANN model is accurate and valid for respiratory illness prediction in individuals in order to plan for solving problems according to the factors influencing the respiratory illness before starting a class.

However, PDs prevalence in the population of agricultural communities lacks understanding and there has been no epidemiological study on the association between pesticides exposure factors and risk for PD. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential association between organophosphate pesticides exposure and Parkinsonism by using a screening questionnaire in agricultural areas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety elderly people living in agricultural areas participated in a cross-sectional study conducted at Tambon Hua-Rua Health Promoting Hospital in April 2014. Screening questionnaires for Parkinson's disease, Test-mate ChE (Model 400) for blood cholinesterase (ChE) levels of both blood enzymes erythrocyte cholinesterase (AChE), and plasma cholinesterase (PChE) were used as measurement tools. Descriptive statistics for frequencies and percentage distributions were used primarily to summarize and describe the data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: The age range of the participants was 50 to 59 years old, with an average age of 53.9Â±2.87 years. The majority of the participants were female (62.2%), 82.2% of respondents were farmers. Most of participants (76.7%) reported that they applied insecticides in their farms. Ninety persons participated and completed the 11-item questionnaire. Of these, 17 (18.9%) felt that they lost balance when turning or that they needed to take a few steps to turn right around and 16.7% of participants indicated that they felt the need to move slowly or stiffly. The study found the prevalence of abnormal AChE levels was 28.9% (95%CI=19.81-39.40) and 17.8% of PChE levels (95%CI=10.52-27.26). To predict Parkinsonism, AChE, and PChE level, with a cutoff score of 5 or higher there had to be a sensitivity of 0.31, specificity of 1.00, positive predictive value (PPV) of 1.00 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.78 for AChE. While PChE, the score value of 5 or more had a sensitivity of 0.19, specificity of 0.93, PPV of 0.38 and NPV of 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: This study described an association between pesticides exposure and Parkinsonism. The questionnaire appears to be useful for Thai agriculturists as a screening tool for Parkinsonism and cholinesterase levels regarding to pesticides exposure.\"},\n",

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess pesticide exposure concentration through dermal and inhalation pathways and to find and depict a relationship between urinary metabolites and means of exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate the pesticides exposure concentration, dermal wipes (hand, face, and feet), dermal patches and air samples were collected from 38 chili farmers. The morning void of pre and post application urine samples was an indicator of biological monitoring in the study which derived from 39 chili farmers. RESULTS: Chlorpyrifos and profenofos residues were detected on dermal patches, face wipes, and hand wipe samples, while no significant residues were found on the feet. Using a personal air sampling technique, all air samples detected pesticide residues. However, significant correlation between dermal pesticide exposure concentration and inhalation was not found (p>0.05). For urinary metabolite levels, there was a relationship between the first pre application morning void and post application morning void (p < 0.05); similar to the association between the first pre application morning void and the second post application morning void (p < 0.05). The main relationship between pesticide exposure and urinary metabolite was found to have been relevant to dermal exposure (r= 0.405; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study could suggested that public health education training programs, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), should be offered for the chili growing farmers in order to improve their ability to properly use pesticides.

The study uses the Structural Vector Auto Regressive model (SVAR) to analyze the effects of unanticipated and temporary shocks to the tone and the semantic similarity on bond yields and stock market returns. Impulse response functions are also constructed for the analysis. The results show that 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year bond yields significantly increase in response to a positive shock to the tone of press releases and 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 1-year and 25-year bond yields significantly increase in response to a positive shock to the semantic similarity.

A cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the association between residential environments and respiratory symptoms including asthma among 658 primary school children living in urban area of Bangkok Thailand. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was modified to access symptoms during the past 12 months. Binary logistic regression model was performed. Living near garment and clothing shop is associated with shortness of breath (AOR = 1.846; 95% CI 1.034, 3.297). Vectors in home is related to dry cough at night (AOR = 1.505; 95% CI 1.052, 2.153) and phlegm (AOR = 1.414; 95% CI 1.014, 1.973). Wall dampness is increased odd of having wheezing or whistling (asthma) in the chest (AOR = 1.921; 95% CI 1.141, 3.235).

Mean, percentage, standard deviation, and stepwise multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine the rates and predictors of the WAI of the participants. Of the 360 participants, 61.40% were women with an average age of 43.00 Â± 11.30 years; 36.70% had completed high school education. Their average work experience was 11.30 Â± 8.50 years. The results revealed that the average WAI was 31.40 Â± 4.15. 76.10% of the participants qualified for the moderate work ability index. The number of current diseases, age, and monthly income were found to significantly contribute to the prediction of the WAI (p < 0.05). This finding suggests that the relevant agencies should support a policy, project or program related to health promotion among the working population with physical health conditions. Promoting occupations should be considered to raise income policy. In doing so, work ability among the working population may be improved.'},\n",

This study aimed to develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to predict respiratory illness among students during gross anatomy dissection classes. All participants were interviewed face-to-face using questionnaires. General information, gross anatomy laboratory room characteristics, and symptoms of respiratory illness during gross anatomy dissection were assessed. The environmental parameters related to indoor air quality, total fungi, and bacteria in a gross anatomy dissection room were measured. Pearsonâ€™s correlation, spearmanâ€™s rank correlation and regression analysis were used to analyse data. The findings revealed ten factors significantly associated with respiratory illness (P < 0.05). The six influencing variables including formaldehyde concentration (personal sampling), bacteria, relative humidity, fungi, time of gross anatomy dissection class, and formaldehyde concentration (area sampling) as tested using regression analysis. ANN model was then run to predict the respiratory illness from those six variables. Predictive accuracy was assessed by the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Square Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value. ANN model showed the least value of MAD, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE when comparing an error value of less than 10%. Therefore, the ANN model is accurate and valid for respiratory illness prediction in individuals in order to plan for solving problems according to the factors influencing the respiratory illness before starting a class. Further research is recommended to improve to model by large-sample-size research.'},\n",

The participant survey data showed that 53.3% of the respondents spent >2 h per crop on preparation, [removed]90% wore long sleeved shirts and pants. VOCs and SVOCs were collected using charcoal tubes and solid phase micro sample extraction (SPME). An analysis of the charcoal and SPME samplers found that 30 compounds were detected overall and that 10 were in both the charcoal tubes and SPME samplers. The chemicals most often detected were 1, 1, 1 Trichloro ethane and xylene. Additionally, farmers experienced the highest exposure to particulates during harvesting. These results demonstrated that farmers experience multiple exposures while farming and that risk communication with education or training programs may mitigate exposure.'},\n",

However, PDs prevalence in the population of agricultural communities lacks understanding and there has been no epidemiological study on the association between pesticides exposure factors and risk for PD. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential association between organophosphate pesticides exposure and Parkinsonism by using a screening questionnaire in agricultural areas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety elderly people living in agricultural areas participated in a cross-sectional study conducted at Tambon Hua-Rua Health Promoting Hospital in April 2014. Screening questionnaires for Parkinson's disease, Test-mate ChE (Model 400) for blood cholinesterase (ChE) levels of both blood enzymes erythrocyte cholinesterase (AChE), and plasma cholinesterase (PChE) were used as measurement tools. Descriptive statistics for frequencies and percentage distributions were used primarily to summarize and describe the data. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated. RESULTS: The age range of the participants was 50 to 59 years old, with an average age of 53.9Â±2.87 years. The majority of the participants were female (62.2%), 82.2% of respondents were farmers. Most of participants (76.7%) reported that they applied insecticides in their farms. Ninety persons participated and completed the 11-item questionnaire. Of these, 17 (18.9%) felt that they lost balance when turning or that they needed to take a few steps to turn right around and 16.7% of participants indicated that they felt the need to move slowly or stiffly. The study found the prevalence of abnormal AChE levels was 28.9% (95%CI=19.81-39.40) and 17.8% of PChE levels (95%CI=10.52-27.26). To predict Parkinsonism, AChE, and PChE level, with a cutoff score of 5 or higher there had to be a sensitivity of 0.31, specificity of 1.00, positive predictive value (PPV) of 1.00 and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.78 for AChE. While PChE, the score value of 5 or more had a sensitivity of 0.19, specificity of 0.93, PPV of 0.38 and NPV of 0.84. CONCLUSIONS: This study described an association between pesticides exposure and Parkinsonism. The questionnaire appears to be useful for Thai agriculturists as a screening tool for Parkinsonism and cholinesterase levels regarding to pesticides exposure.\"},\n",

OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to assess pesticide exposure concentration through dermal and inhalation pathways and to find and depict a relationship between urinary metabolites and means of exposure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To estimate the pesticides exposure concentration, dermal wipes (hand, face, and feet), dermal patches and air samples were collected from 38 chili farmers. The morning void of pre and post application urine samples was an indicator of biological monitoring in the study which derived from 39 chili farmers. RESULTS: Chlorpyrifos and profenofos residues were detected on dermal patches, face wipes, and hand wipe samples, while no significant residues were found on the feet. Using a personal air sampling technique, all air samples detected pesticide residues. However, significant correlation between dermal pesticide exposure concentration and inhalation was not found (p>0.05). For urinary metabolite levels, there was a relationship between the first pre application morning void and post application morning void (p < 0.05); similar to the association between the first pre application morning void and the second post application morning void (p < 0.05). The main relationship between pesticide exposure and urinary metabolite was found to have been relevant to dermal exposure (r= 0.405; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study could suggested that public health education training programs, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), should be offered for the chili growing farmers in order to improve their ability to properly use pesticides.
